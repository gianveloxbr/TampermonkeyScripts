## Which language  can i download the games?

Any, since the script gets the language you're browsing and then download the setup file based on it.
## Can i download games without login?

Right now, no. You need a free account so you can login and download the game properly. I'm already working on it, so expect this feature is a next update.

## Can i download members only game using this script?

You can already do this even without login by clicking on already purchased the game on it's page.
